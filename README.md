# PredictDB-Tutorial

## Goals

This tutorial will provide the steps you need to follow to get you started training prediction models and putting them in a format that can be used to run the predixcan suite of software.

- download the data

- preprocess the genotype

- train the model ...

or follow this nextflow pipeline



## Data
Data for this tutorial is from [here](https://uchicago.box.com/s/ewnrqs31ivobz2sn6462cq2eb423dvpr)

- [ ] TODO: write a post in lab-notes about how to install nextflow and a brief description on how to use it. More details specific to cri if needed.




## This is a tutorial for using GEUVADIS data to run the PredictDB V7 Pipeline
  A description of the pipeline can be found here https://github.com/hakyimlab/PredictDB_Pipeline_GTEx_v7
